                    <h6>Problem</h6>
                    <p>Create a photography app that helps amateur photographers make the transition to DSL-R style photography equipment, therefore boosting sales of the Photostar products.</p>
                    <h6 class="project-properties">Process</h6>
                    <p>This design challenge was the core of the Interaction Design Training I completed with Cooper Professional Education. Our process included reviewing user interviews, doing an ecosystem map, creating continua, reviewing a persona, creating scenarios, and designing a solution.</p>
                    <h6 class="project-properties">Results</h6>
                    <p>Working with other designers, we created a comprehensive and innovative design solution for the problem presented in the training. At the end, we did a mock stakeholder presentation where we described our solution and answered questions about the design.</p>

                <p>We were given six user interviews to review in our group and discuss the different concerns and goals of each individual and how that could impact the design of the Photostar application. Every user had a different relationship with photography and different preferences for why they took photos.</p>

                <h6>Storyboard Scenario: <br>Pt. 1 - Capturing and Sharing</h6>
                <p>Melanie notices her son and a boy starting their friendship and quickly pulls up the Photostar application to capture the moment. She easily aligns the photo using the rules of 3 grid on the screen. The camera app automatically captures in a burst shot when it detects motion to make sure it gets the shot. Melanie is pleasantly surprised by how easy it was and is excited when she sees Photostar offers tips on how to improve her photos. She decides to check them out later, as she wants to stay present with her son at the park.<br>
                Later, when Melanie gets home, she notices a notification reminding her to review her new photos. She is happy that Photostar has helped her remember that she wanted to go through these photos, as she likes to keep her photos organized and wants to post one of them on social media. She scrolls through and gets feedback on the screen on the quality of the photo. She feels rewarded when she sees that Photostar has identified a quality photo and decides to post it on social media using the sharing feature.</p>

                <h6>Storyboard Scenario: <br>Pt. 2 - Practicing Photography in VR</h6>
                <p>She soon gets a lot of hearts and likes from social media and feels proud of her improving photography skills and satisfied with Photostar. She decides to check out the Learning Lab, an area of the app that allows her to practice photography skills in a VR environment. She opens the interface and chooses a lesson about night time photography, where she sees a generated scene where she can control the same camera controls she would use in real life. Photostar gives her feedback on her photo and Melanie feels excited about practicing her new photography skills in the comfort of her own home.</p>

                <h6>Results</h6>
                <p>After giving our presentation on our solution, people were very positive in general about the application idea. The major feedback for change that people suggested was making the Learning Lab a separate application, because it got buried in the Photostar application and was potentially an interesting idea on it's own. Additionally, in terms of the presentation, people felt confused that we included a site map, but we felt it was a good way to illustrate the interaction of the solution.</p>
